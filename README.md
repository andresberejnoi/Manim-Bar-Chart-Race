# Manim-Bar-Chart-Race

A while ago, I made a YouTube video about bar chart animations using a [Matplotlib-based library](https://youtu.be/9hqGRehzEsI?si=zs9AtEbiplEue32U) and now wish to recreate the project using Manim.

I'll make a new YouTube video based on this project and there will be a link to the blog post here.
